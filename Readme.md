# C++ DSA Tutorial

- Welcome to the C++ Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) tutorial.
- This repository contains basic to advanced level C++ programs covering various concepts in DSA.

**Technologies Used:**

- **C++17**: The project is developed using the C++17 standard.
- **Apple Clang**: Compiled using Apple's Clang version 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.26.3) on macOS.
  - If you're using a different compiler (e.g., GCC or MSVC), ensure that it's compatible with C++17 or modify the compilation command to match your environment.

## Introduction

This repository provides a structured and beginner-friendly guide to C++ for learning data structures and algorithms. The tutorial covers:

- C++ syntax basics.
- Implementations of common data structures (arrays, linked lists, trees, etc.).
- Algorithms for sorting, searching, and other operations.

## Setup

To set up this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Abhimanyu-Gaurav/Learn-DSA

2. Install a C++ compiler:

- macOS: Use Apple Clang (which comes with Xcode or Command Line Tools).
- Linux: You can use g++ from the GNU Compiler Collection.
- Windows: Use MinGW for C++ compilation.

3. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd DSA_C++

## How to Run

-  To compile and run the program, follow these steps based on your operating system:

-  Open the terminal and navigate to the project directory.

    ### For macOS and Linux:
    - Compile and run the program using the following command:

        ```bash
        g++ code.cpp && ./a.out

    - This command compiles code.cpp and immediately runs the compiled program (a.out).

    - If you prefer, you can also rename the output file using -o:
        ```bash
        g++ code.cpp -o myprogram && ./myprogram
    
    ### For Windows:
    - Compile the program using the following command:
        ```bash
        g++ code.cpp -o myprogram.exe

    - Run the compiled program:
        ```bash
        myprogram.exe

### Explanation:
- macOS/Linux:
    Use ./a.out or ./myprogram to run the compiled executable. The ./ indicates the current directory.
- Windows:
    The .exe extension is automatically added to the output file, and you donâ€™t need to type ./ before running the program. You can run it by typing myprogram.exe.
